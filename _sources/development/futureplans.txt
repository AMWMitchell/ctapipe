Parallelization
===============

* Explore tools like  `joblib
  <https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/parallel.html#common-usage>`_ for
  very simple parallelization of streams

* More complex parallelization may be achieved via `Execnet
  <http://codespeak.net/execnet/>`_, which can to turn a function into
  a remote processing system.

* more complex systems like `Celery <http://celeryproject.org>`_ may
  be explored for use with map-reduce style parallelization.
