Style Guide
==================

Coding Style
------------

Code should follow the Python PEP8 style guide when appropriate. The
`autopep8` command-line utility can be used to automatically reformat
non-conforming code to the PEP8 style.  It can also be used within
many IDEs, for example:

* emacs (with elpy-mode enabled): `M-x py-autopep8-buffer`


API Documentation Style
-----------------------

All functions, classes, and modules should contain appropriate API
documentation in their *docstrings*.  The *docstrings* should be
written in ReStructuredText format (same as the Sphinx high-level
documentation), and should follow the `NumPy Docstring Standards
